    <content type="text"><![CDATA[NexT is a elegant theme for Hexo. InstallationIf you are familiar with Git, it is recommended that you use the latest version of the clone, and subsequent updates can be updated quickly via git pull instead of downloading the compressed package again.1$ git clone https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next themes/next Enable NexT theme is same mode as all Hexo themes are enabled. When the clone/download is complete, open the _config.yml, find the theme field, and change its value to next.1theme: next MenuAdd menuThe menu configuration consists of three parts, the first is the menu item (name and link), the second is the display text of the menu item, and the third is the icon corresponding to the menu item. NexT uses the icons provided by Font Awesome, and Font Awesome provides 600+ icons for most of the scenes without worrying about blurry icons on the Retina screen. Edit the theme profile \Hexo\theme\next\_config.yml to modify the following: Set the menu content, the corresponding field is menu. The format of the menu content is: item name: link. Where item name is a name that is not directly displayed on the page, it will be used to match icons and translations. The default menu item for NexT is (the item marked with ! indicates that you need to create this page manually): Key_value Set_value Remarks home home: / archives archives: /archives categories categories: /categories ! about about: /about ! tags tags: /tags ! commonweal commonweal: /404.html ! If you need to add a menu item, such as new menu. Then you need to add an item under the menu field:1newmenu: /newmenu_name || icon_name If your site is running in a subdirectory, remove the link prefix /. Set the icon of the menu item, the format is item name: item name: link || icon name, the icon name is the name of the Font Awesome icon. And following commands can be used to control whether to display the icon, you can set it to false to remove the icon.123# Enable/Disable menu icons.menu_icons:enable: true Local searchInstall PluginRun the following commands to install the hexo-generator-searchdb plugin.1$ npm install hexo-generator-searchdb --save Modify site profileAdd the following commands in _config.yml.12345search: pash: search.xml field: post format: html limit: 10000 Modify theme profileSet the \Hexo\theme\next\_config.yml, the corresponding field is local search.1234# Local search# Dependencies: https://github.com/flashlab/hexo-generator-searchlocal_search:enable: true PostWords count &amp; Reading timeInstall PluginRun the following commands to install the hexo-wordcount plugin.1$ npm install hexo-wordcount --save Modify theme profileSet the \Hexo\theme\next\_config.yml, the corresponding field is wordcount.12345678# Post wordcount display settings# Dependencies: https://github.com/willin/hexo-wordcountpost_wordcount:item_text: truewordcount: truemin2read: truetotalcount: falseseparated_meta: true Read moreWay 1 - Modify theme profileSet the \Hexo\theme\next\_config.yml, the corresponding field is auto_excerpt.123auto_excerpt: enable: true length: 150 Way 2 - Excerpt manually in postAdd &lt;!-- more --&gt; anywhere you want in post.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hexo is a great blog framework, but it’s very hard to insert local images in your blog. Because the html file of post and homepage are not in the same directory when the html file is generated. Post’s directory1\folder\public\year\month\day\title\index.html Homepage’s directory1\folder\public\index.html Post Asset FolderFor users who expect to regularly serve images and/or other assets, and for those who prefer to separate their assets on a post-per-post basis, Hexo also provides a more organized way to manage assets. This slightly more involved, but very convenient approach to asset management can be turned on by setting the post_asset_folder setting in _config.yml to true.1post_asset_folder: true With asset folder management enabled, Hexo will creat a folder every time you make a new post with the $ hexo new [layout] &lt;title&gt; command. This asset folder will have the same name as the markdown file associated with the post. Place all assets related to your post into the associated folder, and you will be able to reference them using a relative path, making for an easier and more convenient workflow. Install PluginRun the following commands to install the hexo-asset-image plugin.1$ npm install https://github.com/CodeFalling/hexo-asset-image --save After it finished, just use ![picture-title](title/image.jpg) to insert image.jpg. You also can use ![](title/image.jpg) to insert image.jpg without a picture title. Tag Plugins For Relative Path ReferencingReferencing images or other assets using normal markdown syntax and relative paths may cause them to display incorrectly on archive or index pages. Plugins have been created by the community to address this issue in Hexo 2. However, with the release of Hexo 3, several new tag plugins were added to core. These enable you to reference your assets more easily in posts:123&#123;% asset_path slug %&#125;&#123;% asset_img slug [title] %&#125;&#123;% asset_link slug [title] %&#125; For example, with post asset folders enabled, if you place an image example.jpg into your asset folder, it will not appear on the index page if you reference it using a relative path with regular ![](title/image.jpg) markdown syntax (however, it will work as expected in the post itself). The correct way to reference the image will thus be to use tag plugin syntax rather than markdown:1&#123;% asset_img image.jpg picture-title %&#125; This way, the image will appear both inside the post and on index and archive pages.]]></content>
